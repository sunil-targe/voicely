When Lily and Max unlocked the garden gate, they couldn't believe their eyes! The garden was alive with magicâ€”flowers that sang sweet melodies, trees that grew candy instead of fruit, and butterflies that sparkled like tiny diamonds. A fountain in the center flowed with rainbow-colored water.

The children spent hours exploring every corner of the magical garden. They learned that the garden had been waiting for someone to discover its secrets and bring it back to life with their imagination and wonder.
