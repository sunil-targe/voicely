One day, Thumper heard a tiny voice crying for help. It was a baby bird that had fallen from its nest. The other animals were too busy to notice, but Thumper could see the little bird clearly.

His heart was pounding, but something inside him told him he had to help. Taking a deep breath, Thumper hopped toward the baby bird, trying to ignore his trembling legs.

From that day on, Thumper learned that being brave doesn't mean never being afraid. It means doing what's right even when you're scared. The other animals began to see Thumper differently, and he started to see himself differently too.

He still felt afraid sometimes, but now he knew that courage was a choice he could make every day. The little rabbit who was once so timid became known as the brave little rabbit who helped others find their courage too.
