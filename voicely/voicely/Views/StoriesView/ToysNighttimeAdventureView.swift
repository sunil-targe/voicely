Together, the toys planned their nightly adventure. Teddy Bear suggested they build a castle, Doll wanted to have a tea party, and the wooden blocks were excited to create a magical bridge to the moon.

They worked together, each toy using their special talents. Teddy Bear carried the heavy blocks, Doll set the table with tiny cups, and the toy car raced around delivering messages to all the other toys in the house.

As the first light of dawn peeked through the window, the toys knew it was time to return to their places. They cleaned up their magical castle, put away the tiny tea cups, and settled back into their spots, ready to wait for the children to wake up.

The children never knew about the amazing adventures their toys had while they slept, but they always wondered why their toys seemed to smile a little brighter each morning.
