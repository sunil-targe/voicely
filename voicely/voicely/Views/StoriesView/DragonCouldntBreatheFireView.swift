One day, a terrible storm hit the mountain. The wind was so strong that it blew out all the fires in the dragon caves. The dragons were cold and miserable, and they couldn't cook their food or keep warm.

Spark watched as the other dragons tried to relight their fires, but the wind kept blowing them out. Then he had an idea! His tiny puffs of smoke might be small, but they were gentle and steady.

The other dragons were amazed! Spark's gentle puffs were perfect for carefully tending fires without burning them out. Soon, all the dragon caves were warm and cozy again, and the dragons realized that Spark had a special talent all along.

From that day on, Spark became known as the dragon who could tend fires better than anyone else. He learned that being different doesn't mean being lessâ€”it means having unique gifts that others might need.
