In a dense forest filled with tall pines, lived Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. Their den was a warm cave, perfect for their winter hibernation. As autumn leaves fell, they began preparing for their long sleep, knowing winter was near. They needed food to last and a cozy den to keep them warm.

As the first snowflakes fell, the bears finished their preparations. They checked their food piles‚Äîberries, fish, nuts, and seeds‚Äîand fluffed the moss in their den.

That night, they snuggled close, sharing one last story about a brave bear who saved his family. As they drifted off, the wind howled outside, but their den was warm and safe. The bears slept soundly, dreaming of spring, knowing their love and teamwork would carry them through winter.
