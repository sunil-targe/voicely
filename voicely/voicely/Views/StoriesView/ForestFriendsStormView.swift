One day, dark clouds gathered overhead, and a terrible storm began to rage. The wind howled through the trees, and rain poured down in sheets. The forest friends were scared, but they knew they had to work together to stay safe.

The owl found a sturdy hollow tree for shelter, the squirrel gathered extra food for everyone, the deer helped guide the others to safety, and the rabbit kept everyone's spirits up with funny stories.
