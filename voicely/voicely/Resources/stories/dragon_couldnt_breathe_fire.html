        <div class="title">The Dragon Who Couldn't Breathe Fire</div>
        
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>High up in the misty mountains, where the clouds danced around the peaks like fluffy cotton candy, lived a young dragon named Spark. Unlike all the other dragons in his family, Spark had a very special problemâ€”he couldn't breathe fire!</p>
            
            <p>Every morning, Spark would watch his brothers and sisters practice their fire-breathing skills. They would create beautiful flames that danced in the air like golden ribbons, while Spark could only manage tiny puffs of warm air that quickly disappeared.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Why can't I breathe fire like everyone else?" Spark would ask his mother, his big dragon eyes filled with sadness.</div>
            
            <p>His mother, a wise and gentle dragon, would always smile and say, "Every dragon is special in their own way, my little Spark. Your time will come when you're ready." But Spark wasn't sure he believed her.</p>
            
            <p>One day, as Spark was flying over the forest below his mountain home, he noticed something unusual. A small village was in trouble! A group of mischievous goblins had stolen all the villagers' food and were planning to take their warm blankets too.</p>
            
            <p>The villagers were very scared and didn't know what to do. They had never seen a dragon up close before, and they were afraid Spark might be dangerous. But Spark knew he had to help, even if he couldn't breathe fire.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Don't worry, villagers!" Spark called down in his friendliest voice. "I'm here to help you!"</div>
            
            <p>At first, the villagers were frightened, but they soon realized that Spark was kind and gentle. Spark used his big dragon wings to create a strong wind that blew the goblins away, and his loud dragon roar scared them so much that they never came back.</p>
            
            <p>The villagers were so grateful that they threw a big celebration in Spark's honor. They made him honorary protector of their village and gave him the biggest, tastiest feast he had ever seen.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"You don't need fire to be a hero, Spark!" the village children cheered. "You're the best dragon ever!"</div>
            
            <p>That night, as Spark flew back to his mountain home, he felt something warm and wonderful growing inside him. When he opened his mouth to say goodnight to the stars, a beautiful rainbow of colorful sparks flew out instead of fire!</p>
            
            <p>Spark had discovered his own special talentâ€”he could create magical sparkles that made everyone smile and brought joy to the world. His brothers and sisters were amazed, and his mother was so proud. From that day on, Spark knew that being different was what made him truly special.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Sometimes the best magic isn't fire," Spark would tell other young dragons, "it's the magic of being yourself!"</div>
            
            <p>And so, Spark became known as the Dragon of Joyful Sparkles, and he lived happily ever after, spreading happiness and teaching everyone that being unique is the most wonderful magic of all.</p>
