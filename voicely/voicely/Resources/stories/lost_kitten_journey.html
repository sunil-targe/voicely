        <div class="title">The Lost Kitten's Journey Home</div>
        
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Once upon a time, in a cozy little house at the end of a winding path, lived a tiny orange kitten named Whiskers. Whiskers was the most curious little cat you could ever imagine, always exploring every nook and cranny of her home and the garden beyond.</p>
            
            <p>One sunny afternoon, while Whiskers was playing in the garden, she spotted a beautiful butterfly with wings as blue as the sky. The butterfly fluttered just out of reach, and Whiskers, being the curious kitten she was, decided to follow it.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Come back, pretty butterfly!" Whiskers meowed, her tiny paws padding after the fluttering creature.</div>
            
            <p>The butterfly led Whiskers deeper and deeper into the garden, past the rose bushes and through the tall grass. Whiskers was so focused on catching the butterfly that she didn't notice how far she had wandered from home.</p>
            
            <p>When the butterfly finally disappeared into the sky, Whiskers looked around and realized she was in a part of the garden she had never seen before. The trees looked different, the flowers were unfamiliar, and worst of all, she couldn't see her cozy little house anywhere!</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Oh no! Where am I? Where is my home?" Whiskers cried, her little heart beating fast with worry.</div>
            
            <p>Whiskers tried to find her way back, but every path looked the same. She meowed loudly, hoping her family would hear her, but only the birds in the trees answered with their sweet songs.</p>
            
            <p>Just when Whiskers was starting to feel very scared and lonely, she met a wise old mouse who was gathering seeds near a big oak tree. The mouse had kind eyes and a gentle voice.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Hello, little kitten," the mouse said softly. "You look lost. Can I help you find your way home?"</div>
            
            <p>Whiskers told the mouse all about her cozy house and how she had followed a butterfly and gotten lost. The mouse listened carefully and then smiled.</p>
            
            <p>"I know exactly where your house is!" the mouse said. "I've seen it many times when I'm out gathering food. It's the one with the purple flowers in the window boxes and the red door."</p>
            
            <p>The mouse offered to show Whiskers the way home, and together they walked through the garden. The mouse knew all the secret paths and shortcuts, and soon they could see Whiskers' house in the distance.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"There it is! My home!" Whiskers exclaimed with joy, her tail straight up in the air with excitement.</div>
            
            <p>When they reached the house, Whiskers' family was so happy to see her! They had been worried sick and had been looking everywhere for their little kitten. Whiskers purred and rubbed against their legs, so happy to be home again.</p>
            
            <p>From that day on, Whiskers learned to be more careful when exploring, and she always made sure she could see her house before wandering too far. But she never forgot the kind mouse who had helped her find her way home.</p>
            
            <div class="dialogue">"Thank you, dear mouse friend," Whiskers said, giving the mouse a gentle nuzzle. "You're the best friend a lost kitten could have!"</div>
            
            <p>And so, Whiskers lived happily ever after in her cozy little house, but now she was wiser and knew that the best adventures are the ones where you can always find your way back home.</p>
