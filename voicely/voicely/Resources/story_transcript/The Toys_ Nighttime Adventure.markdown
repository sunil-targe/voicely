# The Toys' Nighttime Adventure
## When the Lights Go Out

In a cozy bedroom filled with colorful toys, Teddy the bear, Dolly the doll, and Car the toy car waited for bedtime. Every night, when the lights went out and their owner, Mia, fell asleep, the toys came to life. They loved exploring the bedroom, climbing bookshelves, and racing across the rug.

One night, Teddy whispered, “Let’s have a big adventure!” Dolly and Car agreed, and they tiptoed out of the bedroom, sliding down the stairs on a blanket. In the living room, they found new friends—kitchen toys like Spoon and Teacup. They rode the vacuum cleaner like a roller coaster, giggling as they zoomed around. Dolly hosted a tea party, with Teacup pouring pretend tea while Teddy told funny stories.

As the clock ticked closer to morning, Car suggested a race back to the bedroom. They dodged pillows and jumped over shoes, making it just before Mia’s alarm rang. Back in their places, they looked still and quiet, but their hearts were full of joy. Their secret adventures made them feel special, knowing they brought magic to Mia’s world, even if she never knew.
