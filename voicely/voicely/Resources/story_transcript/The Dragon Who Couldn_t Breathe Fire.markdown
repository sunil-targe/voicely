# The Dragon Who Couldn't Breathe Fire
## Finding Your Own Way to Shine

High in the mountains of a faraway land, a young dragon named Draco lived in a sparkling cave. Unlike his friends, who could breathe bright flames that lit up the sky, Draco’s breath only produced a puff of smoke. At dragon school, others teased him, saying, “A dragon without fire is no dragon at all!” Draco felt sad, curling up in his cave, wishing he could be like the others.

One cold evening, a fierce storm swept through the dragon village. Rain poured, and winds howled, extinguishing every fire the dragons tried to light to keep their homes warm. The villagers shivered, and Draco felt helpless. As he watched the struggling flames, he noticed his wings were much larger than those of other dragons. An idea sparked in his mind.

Draco flapped his mighty wings, standing over the village fire pit. “I’ll protect the flame!” he called. He spread his wings wide, shielding the fire from the rain and wind. The flames grew stronger, warming the village. The other dragons cheered, amazed at Draco’s cleverness. Even the elders, who had seen many storms, praised him. “Your wings are your gift,” they said. “You’ve saved us all.”

From that day, Draco no longer felt ashamed. He practiced using his wings to help in new ways—fanning flames to make them stronger or carrying supplies for the village. His friends stopped teasing him and instead asked for his help during storms. Draco learned that everyone has a unique way to shine, and his wings were his greatest strength.
