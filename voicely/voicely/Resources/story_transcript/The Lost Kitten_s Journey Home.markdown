# The Lost Kitten's Journey Home
## Kindness Leads the Way

Mittens was a fluffy kitten with big, curious eyes, living in a cozy house with her family. She loved chasing butterflies and exploring the garden, but one day, her curiosity led her too far. She wandered into the busy city, where tall buildings loomed and cars honked loudly. Lost and scared, Mittens hid under a bench, meowing softly.

A kind boy named Timmy spotted her while walking home from school. “Don’t worry, little one,” he said gently, kneeling beside her. He scooped Mittens up and took her to his house, where he gave her a saucer of milk and a soft blanket. Timmy noticed Mittens had no collar, so he decided to help find her family. He drew posters with Mittens’ picture, writing, “Lost Kitten! Please Help!” and hung them around the city.

Meanwhile, Mittens’ family was frantic, searching every corner of their neighborhood. They called her name, but she was too far away. Days passed, and Mittens missed her cozy bed, but Timmy kept her safe, playing with her and telling her stories. One morning, Timmy’s posters worked—a neighbor recognized Mittens and called her family.

When Mittens’ family arrived, they hugged Timmy and thanked him with tears in their eyes. Mittens purred loudly, happy to be home. Timmy visited her often, and they became best friends. Mittens learned to stay close to home, and Timmy felt proud knowing his kindness had made a difference.
