# The Mermaid's Ocean Lesson
## Protecting Our Seas

Marina was a young mermaid with a shimmering tail, living in a coral palace deep in the ocean. She loved swimming with dolphins, racing with seahorses, and singing with whales. But one day, she noticed the water was cloudy, and her fish friends looked sick. Plastic bottles and bags floated everywhere, tangling the seaweed.

Determined to help, Marina explored the ocean to find the problem. She discovered humans on the shore throwing trash into the sea, unaware of the harm it caused. Marina gathered her mermaid friends—Coral, Bubbles, and Finn—and they began cleaning. They untangled seaweed, collected trash, and taught fish to avoid dangerous areas. It was hard work, but they sang sea shanties to stay cheerful.

Marina also swam to the shore, where children played. She popped her head above the waves and said, “Please keep our ocean clean!” The children listened, wide-eyed, and promised to tell others. They started picking up trash and making signs to remind everyone. Over time, the ocean sparkled again, and the fish swam happily. Marina and her friends celebrated with a grand underwater dance, knowing they’d made a difference together.
