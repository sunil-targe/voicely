# The Forest Friends and the Storm
## Teamwork Saves the Day

Deep in a lush green forest, a group of animals lived together like a big family. There was Ella the elephant, who loved splashing in the river; Leo the lion, who roared proudly; Tilly the turtle, who moved slowly but surely; and many others. They shared sunny days playing and telling stories. But one afternoon, dark clouds gathered, and the wind whispered of a coming storm that could flood their homes.

Ella trumpeted, “We must protect our homes!” The animals panicked, unsure what to do. Tilly suggested building a dam to divert the river’s water, and Leo agreed, roaring to gather everyone. Ella, with her long trunk, began piling logs that Leo dragged from the forest. Tilly carried small stones in her shell, stacking them carefully. Even the tiny mice helped, rolling pebbles to the dam. The birds flew above, warning of the storm’s approach.

As thunder rumbled, the animals worked faster, singing songs to keep their spirits high. Ella placed the final log just as rain began to pour. The dam held strong, guiding the river away from their homes. The animals cheered, safe and dry. That night, they gathered under a big oak tree, sharing a feast of berries and nuts. Ella, Leo, and Tilly smiled, knowing their teamwork had saved the day. From then on, they faced every challenge together, stronger as a family.
